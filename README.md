# DEVICE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
A NLP project on Device Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity. The CSV fle (1925 x 9) is the Dataset. A List is formed by pre-processing such as extracting Stop words, removing all the Punctuations, Blank spaces, and concatenating them to form a Bag of Words. Create a matrix with all the vectors. Calculate the cosine similarity of the matrix. Once the user gives Model Name as the input, calculate the Score, refer to the Similarity Matrix, and extract the devices which have the Similar Configuration. The top 15 devices are sorted and displayed to the user.

**FUTURE SCOPE:**
To Deploy in a website. It can be done using Flask Library. By integrating with Front end, the user is more convenient with the GUI and Recommendation System. The Dataset can be deployed in a Backend Database to increase the No.of devices and provide accurate recommendations.
