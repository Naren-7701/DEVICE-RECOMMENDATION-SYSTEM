# DEVICE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
A NLP project on Device Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity. Execute in either Jupyter or Google Collab. The CSV fle (1925 x 9) is the Dataset. A List is formed by pre-processing such as extracting Stop words, removing all the Punctuations, Blank spaces, and concatenating them to form a Bag of Words. Create a matrix with all the vectors. Calculate the cosine similarity of the matrix. The devices with the highest cosine similarity score would be recommended to the user. Once the user gives Model Name as the input, calculate the Score, refer to the Similarity Matrix, and extract the devices which have the Similar Configuration. The top 15 devices are sorted and displayed to the user.
